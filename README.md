# toyvm

A small toy virtual machine (C) and assembler (Python) for it I wrote in March 2008 or thereabouts.
The original SVN history is lost to the ages.

Figured why not put the source up, even if the quality is... well, it was and is a hack.

You can find some Win32 binaries from that time in bin/, if you dare.
